# Portfolio 

## Description 

This site is used to showcase any of the work that I have worked on in the past. In it you will find a short description with a couple of picture links that 
will take you to the sites I have worked on. 

As of right now this is a very rough draft until I can get a handle on some of the more complicated elements/properties.
